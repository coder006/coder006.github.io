      <description>I am a software engineer by day and a casual gamer by night. I bought the Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop about 2 years ago to fulfill my gaming needs.
Apart from playing a few games, I also use this laptop for some side projects or experimenting on different software tools from time to time. One of the things that has long troubled me and others who are into both programming and gaming, is the lack of games for operating systems other than Windows. Most of the developers that I interact with on a daily basis run with a Macbook, while a few adventurous ones use Linux as their daily driver.</description>
