      <title>Elasticsearch Backup and Restore with AWS S3 in Kubernetes</title>

      <description>In my day job, I get a chance of working with things like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and various cloud components across cloud providers. We have multiple Elasticsearch clusters running inside our Kubernetes cluster (EKS). These Elasticsearch clusters have been installed using the well-known package manager for Kubernetes &amp;ndash; Helm as Helm charts. Recently, I had to set up a disaster-recovery strategy for these Elasticsearch clusters to restore these clusters to a previous stable state in case of a failure.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote, and the post on Kubernetes Readiness probes has been long overdue. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out the first part of this post on Kubernetes Liveness Probes, I suggest you to check that out. In this post, we will be looking mainly at the Readiness Probe and how it can be used to monitor the health of your applications.
As discussed earlier, Kubernetes provides 3 different kinds of health checks to monitor the state of your applications:</description>

      <description>It was not very long ago when we were deploying individual services on each Virtual Machine. This process required the engineer in charge of the deployment process to be aware of all the machines where each service was deployed. Sure, people had build great solutions around this deployment model like tagging their EC2 machines with special names and using automation tools like Rundeck, Jenkins, etc., to automate the deployment process. Although this process had matured to a great extent over several years, it still had it&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings like &amp;ndash; random application crashes, ineffecient deployment practices, poor reselience to failures, improper resource utilization, and bad practices around secret and configuration management.</description>

      <title>Terraform Helm Kubernetes Elasticsearch Setup</title>
      <link>https://ambar.dev/posts/tf-helm-kubernetes-elasticsearch-setup/</link>

      <guid>https://ambar.dev/posts/tf-helm-kubernetes-elasticsearch-setup/</guid>
      <description>Github Repository: tf-helm-kubernetes-elasticsearch
 Note: This guide uses Terraform for making API calls and state management. If you have helm installed on your machine, you can use that instead for installing the chart.
 What is Elasticsearch? According to the Elasticsearch website:
 Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.
 Elasticsearch is generally used as the underlying engine for platforms that perform complex text search, logging, or real-time advanced analytics operations.</description>

      <title>Aws Alicloud Vpn Setup Terraform</title>
      <link>https://ambar.dev/posts/aws-alicloud-vpn-setup-terraform/</link>

      <guid>https://ambar.dev/posts/aws-alicloud-vpn-setup-terraform/</guid>
      <description>Github Repository: tf-aws-alicloud-vpn
 Note: This is not a guide on the internals of a Virtual Private Network. Rather, this post outlines how to setup a VPN connection between AWS and Alicloud. This guide uses Terraform for making API calls and state management. You can chose to use any HTTP client or aws and alicloud CLIs as well for making the same API calls and end up with a working VPN connection.</description>
